INTROSPECTION
Why must we choose you?
			I was introduced in to the field of coding in 9th as a part of our syllabus. During the initial days, it was not easy but the feeling that I can do it was all I had.SLowly I started enjoying whil edoing program sand it is then I realized here is where my interest lies.Passion is not only thing YOU need to acheive something, you also need a mind which won't rest untill you acheied it. I believe I have that and that why I personally I must be selected.
What is your plan for the next 6 months?
			WHile doing these task I realized thaht  I am not even a beginner in this field and have to go more. THerefor my first priority is to complete all amfoss task irrespective whether I am selected or not. For me acedamics is also not behind.So looking forward to manage both.
How would you contribute back to the club?
			I am assured of one thing. That is I can and I will break my limits and work harder to make AMfoss and Amrita and my parents and me in the best possible manner.
Do you have any feedback for the selection process?			
			The selection process was great and it gave a intro about what we are going to do in the club if we are selected. It was something that can inspire to learn new tihngs.
			But one thing I need to mention is that there could have been more guiadance on how to do task.Since I felt it is neccassary to atleast students from non cs background. Hope this wouldn't have come if it was online.
