#ABOUT ME
I am krishnendu from cse batch. I was a cs student in 12th. I had a little bit of knowledge in Java. It was through Java I was attracted towards coding.


# amfoss-tasks
I was interseted in coding and was looking forward to do amfoss tasks. But there has been a many obstacles in my way. 
I was not able to complete many tasks because time consumed for other task was more than I thought and I was so disappointed to get along with.
Now, I realized that I am just at the doorsteps and have to go ahead more.
At end, I learned many new things for this task and I strongly believe one day I will surely complete all these tasks.
